# Adapt the theme to your brand

When you start a new project, one of the first things that you will need to do is to adapt the look and feel of adaptcommerce to match your brand's style.

Obviously, it is not something that can be done in just a few minutes because your identity shines in the details.
However, you can do all the heavylifting pretty quickly by customizing what is called **Design Tokens**.

And it's a great way to familiarize yourself with adaptcommerce!

## Get your Design Tokens

This concept is often closely related to Design Systems.
Basically Design Tokens are the _core styles_ of your design: colors, font families, font sizes, borders, shadows, etc.
Together they are what make your brand unique.

There even exist tools that extract those tokens from existing websites.
In this example, we will use [CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com/) to extract our Design Tokens.

If you want to learn more about it, you can have a look at [Design tokens for dummies](https://uxdesign.cc/design-tokens-for-dummies-8acebf010d71) which is a very nice introduction.

## Apply these tokens to your theme

Now that we've got our Design Tokens, let's apply them to adaptcommerce's theme.

Since we use the Atomic Design principles, the tokens are within the atoms in `/web/theme/components/atoms`.
In this guide, we'll focus on the colors and the typography settings.
But feel free to go further and edit buttons, form inputs, etc.

> Be it with adaptcommerce or with adaptcommerce, it works the same way.
> The only difference is that before editing the files, you should copy them from the core and add them to your custom module.

In order to style our HTML, we use Sass, the well-known CSS preprocessor.
Thus, the design tokens often translate to Sass variables.

For instance, if we want to edit the colors of our application, we need to go to `src/web/theme/components/atoms/Colors/Colors.scss` and edit the colors we want to.
In Smashing Magazine's case it would be:

```diff
/* Adapt the variables that needs to change */

-$brandPrimaryBackground: #0a5e66;
-$brandHoverPrimary: #12828c;
-$brandPrimary: #39b4bf;
-$brandSecondary: #818199;
+$brandPrimaryBackground: #bc3428;
+$brandHoverPrimary: #c7372a;
+$brandPrimary: #d33a2c;
+$brandSecondary: #2da2c5;
```

In the same spirit, we could change the fonts to match Smashing Magazine's.
This change happens in `src/web/theme/components/atoms/Typography/Typography.scss` and `src/web/theme/components/atoms/Typography/Heading/Heading.scss`.

```diff
// src/web/theme/components/atoms/Typography/Typography.scss
-$mainFontFamily: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen,
-  Ubuntu, Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;
+@font-face {
+  font-family: 'Elena';
+  font-display: swap;
+  src: url('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a978f759fa0230c1e590d1bdb5a1c03ceb538cec/fed6b/fonts/elenawebregular/elenawebregular.woff2') format('woff2');
+}
+
+$mainFontFamily: Elena, Georgia, serif;

+@font-face {
+  font-family: "Mija";
+  font-display: swap;
+  src: url("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b324ee03d5048d2d1831100e323b0b6336ffce68/0445e/fonts/mijaregular/mija_regular-webfont.woff2")
+    format("woff2");
+}
+
+$titleFontFamily: Mija, Arial, sans-serif;
```

```diff
// src/web/theme/components/atoms/Typography/Heading/Heading.scss
+h1,
+h2,
+h3 {
+  font-family: $titleFontFamily;
+}
```

adaptcommerce would then now look like this:

  <img
    alt="A comparison between the original FC Lite and FC Lite with Smashing Magazine's tokens"
    src="/docs/assets/smashingmagazine-product.png"
  />
</figure>

Sure it still needs tweaking, but as you can see, it is already far better.
Furthermore, it is an easy first step to convince your clients that using modern front-end technologies is for the best.

## Expand your brand theme

Please note that all we've been talking about until now was to adapt the existing to your convenience.
However, that is not the only benefit of having a Design System already in place.
It is actually a perfect canvas to help you creating new components and styles matching to your brand.

You can learn more about it in our guide talking about [creating new UI Components](create-a-ui-component.md).
