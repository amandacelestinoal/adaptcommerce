# Breakpoints (Atom)

Breakpoints are the point a which your sites content will respond to provide the
user with the best possible layout to consume the information.

We recommend to use breakpoints in a mobile-first way: default styles are for
mobile devices and media queries should be used for wider screens.

## Usage

Breakpoints are Sass variables.

```scss
@media screen and (min-width: $tablet) {
  // styles here
}
```
